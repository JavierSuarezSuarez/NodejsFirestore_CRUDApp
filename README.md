# Node.js CRUD App with Firebase´s Firestore database

This project consists of a Web App (an API REST is also included) made in Node.js using Firestore DB.

The aim is to learn about this technology, so that´s the reason why the webpages are simple without styling.

To run this project, you will need Node.js, npm and a Firestore DB. Once you have it all, run ```npm install``` to 
retrieve all dependencies needed. 

If you are interested in testing the API, you will need also a HTTP Client such as Postman.

You will note that a file called ```permisos.json``` is needed and not included in the repository. That´s because
it contains Firestore credentials that you will have to get according to your DB. Also, you will have to set
the database URL in ```index.js``` to comply with your setup.


Once you have all, run ```npm start``` or ```node index.js``` while in project´s folder and go to http://localhost:5000/

Hope you enjoy it!
